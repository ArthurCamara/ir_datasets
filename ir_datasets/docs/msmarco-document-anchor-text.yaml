<p>
For version 1 of MS MARCO, the anchor text collection enriches 1,703,834 documents with anchor text. To keep the collection size reasonable, we sampled 1,000 anchor texts for documents with more than 1,000 anchor texts (this sampling yields that all anchor text is included for 94% of the documents), and the remaining anchor text pointing to the same document are concatenated. The raw dataset with additional information (roughly 100GB) from which the concatenated anchor text is constructed is <a href="https://github.com/webis-de/ecir22-anchor-text">available online</a>.
