  data_access: '
<p>
To use the 2019 and 2021 versions of the corpus, you need copies of <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/">Washington Post Collection</a>,
provided by NIST.
</p>
<p>
Your organization may already have a copy. If this is the case, you may only need to complete a new
"Individual Argeement". Otherwise, your organization will need to file the "Organizational agreement"
with NIST. It can take some time to process, but you will end up with a password-protected download link.
</p>
<p>
For the 2019 corpus, the source file required is <kbd>WashingtonPost.v2.tar.gz</kbd>.
ir_datasets expects the above file to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/wapo/WashingtonPost.v2.tar.gz</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
For the 2021 corpus, the source file required is <kbd>WashingtonPost.v4.tar.gz</kbd>.
ir_datasets expects the above file to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/wapo/WashingtonPost.v4.tar.gz</kbd>.
